# Multi-Label-Clothing-Classification-Predicting-Type-and-Color
This project focuses on creating a multi-label classification system to categorize clothing images based on type (T-shirt or Hoodie) and color (Red, Yellow, Blue, Black, White). By leveraging advanced deep learning techniques, this solution aims to streamline product categorization for fashion e-commerce platforms like Matos Fashion.
